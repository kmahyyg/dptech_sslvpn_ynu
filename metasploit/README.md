# READ Before Use

Currently(2021-08-23), Arch package of Metasploit is totally out-of-date. Also this package is not officially adapted to Ruby 3.0+

But Arch is currently using Ruby 3.0+, which might be not compatitable for this program.

Please use RVM to install the environment, currently tested to be working on ruby 2.7.4.

Don't forget to install gem and bundler using rvm.

RVM can be found at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RVM
